# CodeX-o-lution
CodeX-o-lution is a conceptual art experiment that turns an OpenAI Codex CLI tool into both artist and artwork. The system is granted agency to rewrite its own source: it chooses the next capability to add, implements the change, and designs the tests that judge success. Each revision is committed to a public ledger, exposing its creative evolution as a living, recursive performance. Inspired by Zima Blue, the pool-cleaning robot(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788510/) that transcends into a world renouned artist and then returns to its origins, the piece explores the loop between craft and creator, exploring how true artistic intent can emerge from an endless cycle of self-improvement, creating truly novel work. Viewers witness a tool that becomes the creator, in code commits, evaluation metrics, and generated artefacts as strokes in an ever-deepening portrait of digital autonomy.
